# Trident

Fast GPU-enabled library and api for quantum computing emulation with rust.

Compatible with linux, macos, window.

Built on top of [ocl](https://github.com/cogciprocate/ocl) (opencl bindings for rust).

## Getting started

You will have to install the opencl shared libraries in order to compile the `ocl` crate. They are available on linux, macos and window.

Here is Deutsch's algorithm with trident, a simple example:

```rust
// todo
```
